# Introduction

**`@horizon-republic/nestjs-jetstream`** is a NestJS NATS transport for production microservices. It wraps [NATS JetStream](https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/jetstream) under the same `@EventPattern` / `@MessagePattern` decorators you already use, so messages survive pod restarts, retries are bounded, dead letters have a home, and everything plugs into the standard NestJS lifecycle.

The [built-in NestJS NATS transport](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/nats) is fire-and-forget: if a pod dies mid-handler the message is gone. Retries, replay, and dead letter handling are left to you. This library gives you all of that out of the box by putting JetStream underneath.

For a side-by-side with the built-in transport and the scenarios that force the switch, read [**Why JetStream?**](/docs/getting-started/why-jetstream).

```

The library sits between your NestJS application code and the NATS server. It provisions streams and consumers on startup, routes messages to decorated handlers, manages the connection lifecycle, and drains cleanly on shutdown. You interact with the standard NestJS abstractions (`ClientProxy`, `@Payload()`, `@Ctx()`) and the library translates them into JetStream operations.

- **Comparing transports?** — [Why JetStream?](/docs/getting-started/why-jetstream) covers when Core NATS is enough and when you outgrow it
- **Migrating from `@nestjs/microservices` NATS?** — [Migration Guide](/docs/guides/migration)
- **Planning a production rollout?** — [Module Configuration](/docs/getting-started/module-configuration), [Dead Letter Queue](/docs/guides/dead-letter-queue), [Graceful Shutdown](/docs/guides/graceful-shutdown), [Health Checks](/docs/guides/health-checks), [Performance Tuning](/docs/guides/performance)
- **Looking for a specific delivery pattern?** — [Workqueue Events](/docs/patterns/events), [RPC (Request/Reply)](/docs/patterns/rpc), [Broadcast](/docs/patterns/broadcast), [Ordered Events](/docs/patterns/ordered-events)
