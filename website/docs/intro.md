# Introduction

**@horizon-republic/nestjs-jetstream** is a production-grade NestJS transport for [NATS JetStream](https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/jetstream). It brings persistent, at-least-once messaging to NestJS microservices while staying true to the framework's `@EventPattern` / `@MessagePattern` programming model.

## Why this library?

NestJS ships with a [built-in NATS transport](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/nats), but it operates exclusively over NATS Core — a fire-and-forget, in-memory pub/sub layer. That's fine for ephemeral messages, but when you need:

- **Persistent delivery** — messages survive broker and consumer restarts
- **At-least-once semantics** — automatic redelivery on failure with configurable retry limits
- **Stream-based replay** — new consumers can catch up on historical messages
- **Fan-out broadcast** — every running instance of a service receives every message

...you need JetStream. This library manages streams, consumers, and subjects automatically so you can focus on business logic instead of NATS plumbing.

## Feature overview

| Capability | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Workqueue Events** | At-least-once delivery, one handler instance processes each message |
| **Broadcast Events** | Fan-out to all subscribing services via per-service durable consumers |
| **Ordered Events** | Strict sequential delivery with automatic failover (Limits retention) |
| **RPC — Core mode** | NATS native request/reply for lowest latency |
| **RPC — JetStream mode** | Commands persisted in a stream, responses via Core NATS inbox |
| **Dead Letter Queue** | Callback when a message exhausts all delivery attempts |
| **Lifecycle Hooks** | Observable events: connect, disconnect, errors, timeouts, shutdown |
| **Health Checks** | `JetstreamHealthIndicator` for readiness/liveness probes |
| **Custom Codec** | Pluggable serialization — JSON (default), MessagePack, Protobuf, etc. |
| **Graceful Shutdown** | Drain in-flight messages before closing the connection |
| **Message Scheduling** | One-shot delayed delivery via NATS 2.12 `Nats-Schedule` headers |
| **Publisher-only mode** | `consumer: false` for API gateways that only emit messages |

```

The library sits between your NestJS application code and the NATS server. It:

1. **Manages infrastructure** — creates and updates JetStream streams and consumers on startup
2. **Routes messages** — maps NATS subjects to your `@EventPattern` and `@MessagePattern` handlers
3. **Handles lifecycle** — connection management, graceful shutdown, error propagation

You interact with standard NestJS abstractions (`ClientProxy`, `@Payload()`, `@Ctx()`) and the library translates them into JetStream operations.

## What you'll learn

This documentation is organized into sections that progressively build on each other:

- [**Getting Started**](/docs/getting-started/installation) — install and run your first handler in minutes
- [**Core Concepts**](/docs/patterns/events) — events, RPC, record builder, and handler context — what you'll use daily
- [**Advanced Patterns**](/docs/patterns/broadcast) — broadcast, ordered events, and message scheduling
- [**Going to Production**](/docs/getting-started/module-configuration) — full configuration, DLQ, health checks, lifecycle hooks, graceful shutdown, and performance tuning
- [**Reference**](/docs/reference/naming-conventions) — naming conventions, default configs, edge cases, custom codec, migration, and troubleshooting
