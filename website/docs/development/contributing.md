# Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community. The full contribution guidelines live in the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/HorizonRepublic/nestjs-jetstream/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file at the repository root. This page provides a quick overview.

## Quick Start

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub
2. **Clone** your fork and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nestjs-jetstream.git
   cd nestjs-jetstream
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Create a branch** for your change:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Make your changes**, write tests, and verify everything passes:

   ```bash
   pnpm lint
   pnpm test
   ```

5. **Push** and open a Pull Request

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20.0.0
- pnpm 10.x or higher
- Docker (integration tests use [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com/) to start NATS automatically)

## Development Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `pnpm build` | Build the library (tsup, dual CJS/ESM) |
| `pnpm build:watch` | Build in watch mode |
| `pnpm lint` | Check for linting issues |
| `pnpm lint:fix` | Auto-fix linting issues |
| `pnpm test` | Run all tests |
| `pnpm test:cov` | Run tests with coverage |
| `pnpm docs:dev` | Start Docusaurus dev server |
| `pnpm docs:build` | Build the documentation site |
| `pnpm docs:generate` | Regenerate TypeDoc API reference (not `pnpm docs` — conflicts with npm built-in) |

See [Testing](/docs/development/testing) for detailed test conventions and setup.

## Commit Message Format

The project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) with [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) for automated releases. Your commit messages determine how the changelog and version bumps are generated.

| Prefix | Purpose | Version Bump |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `feat:` | New feature | Minor |
| `fix:` | Bug fix | Patch |
| `docs:` | Documentation | None |
| `refactor:` | Code refactoring | None |
| `test:` | Adding/updating tests | None |
| `chore:` | Maintenance | None |

**Examples:**

```text
feat: add support for custom stream configuration
fix(strategy): remove private logger that shadows Server base class
docs: update module configuration examples
```

:::tip
Use a scope in parentheses (e.g., `feat(client):`, `fix(strategy):`) to indicate the area of the codebase affected. This shows up in the generated changelog.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Ensure the build passes (`pnpm build`)
- All linting checks must pass (`pnpm lint`)
- All existing tests must pass, and new code should include tests
- Use clear, descriptive PR titles — they become changelog entries via Release Please
- Keep PRs focused on a single concern

## Coding Standards

- TypeScript for all code
- JSDoc comments on all public APIs
- Follow existing code style (enforced by ESLint + Prettier)
- See [Testing](/docs/development/testing) for test conventions (`sut` naming, `createMock<T>()`, Given-When-Then, etc.)
