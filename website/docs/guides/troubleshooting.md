# Troubleshooting

If something isn't working, start here. The sections below are grouped by symptom — scan them before opening an issue.

## Connection errors

### `NATS connection refused`

The transport throws this on startup when the NATS server is unreachable.

**Causes:**
- NATS server is not running
- Wrong server URL in `servers` config
- Firewall or network policy blocking the port

**Fix:**
```bash
# Verify NATS is running
nats-server --version
docker ps | grep nats

# Test connectivity
nats server check connection --server nats://localhost:4222
```

### `CONNECTION_REFUSED` in production

If the app crashes immediately on deploy, ensure the NATS server URL is correct for the environment. Use `forRootAsync()` with `ConfigService` to load URLs from environment variables:

```typescript
JetstreamModule.forRootAsync({
  name: 'my-service',
  imports: [ConfigModule],
  inject: [ConfigService],
  useFactory: (config: ConfigService) => ({
    servers: config.get<string>('NATS_SERVERS')!.split(','),
  }),
})
```

### Reconnection loop

The transport defaults to unlimited reconnection (`maxReconnectAttempts: -1`). If you see repeated `Reconnecting...` logs, the NATS server is flapping or the connection is being dropped.

**Diagnosis:**
1. Register a `Reconnect` hook to see when reconnections happen:
   ```typescript
   hooks: {
     [TransportEvent.Reconnect]: (server) => console.log(`Reconnected to ${server}`),
   }
   ```
2. Check NATS server logs for client disconnect reasons.
3. Verify TLS certificates haven't expired.

## Consumer issues

### Messages not being delivered

**Checklist:**
1. **Handler registered?** — Check startup logs for `Registered handlers: X RPC, Y events, Z broadcasts` (plus `N ordered` when ordered handlers are present). A zero count means the decorator didn't hit the registry — usually an import-order or module-wiring problem.
2. **Stream exists?** — The transport creates streams on startup. Check with `nats stream ls`.
3. **Consumer exists?** — Check with `nats consumer ls <stream-name>`.
4. **Subject matches?** — Use `nats sub "servicename__microservice.ev.>"` to see if messages arrive on the expected subject.
5. **Publisher-only mode?** — If `consumer: false` is set, no handlers are registered.

### Messages redelivered unexpectedly

Messages are redelivered when the `ack_wait` deadline expires before the handler acknowledges them.

**Causes:**
- Handler is too slow (exceeds `ack_wait`)
- Handler throws an error (message is nak'd for retry)
- Connection lost during processing

**Fix:**
- Increase `ack_wait`: `consumer: { ack_wait: toNanos(60, 'seconds') }`
- Enable `ackExtension: true` for long-running handlers
- Set explicit `concurrency` to prevent overload

### Consumer lag growing

If your consumer is falling behind (messages accumulating faster than they're processed):

1. **Increase concurrency:** `events: { concurrency: 200 }`
2. **Increase `max_ack_pending`:** `consumer: { max_ack_pending: 500 }`
3. **Scale horizontally:** Deploy more instances — each gets a share of the workqueue messages.
4. **Check handler performance:** Profile your handlers. Database queries, external API calls, and heavy computations are common bottlenecks.

Monitor lag with the NATS CLI:
```bash
nats consumer info <stream> <consumer> | grep "Num Pending"
```

## RPC issues

### `RPC timeout` errors

The caller didn't receive a response within the timeout period.

**Causes:**
- Handler is slow or stuck
- No handler registered for the pattern
- Network partition between publisher and consumer
- Wrong RPC mode — publisher uses `core` but handler expects `jetstream` (or vice versa)

**Diagnosis:**
```typescript
hooks: {
  [TransportEvent.RpcTimeout]: (subject, correlationId) =>
    console.warn(`RPC timeout: ${subject} (${correlationId})`),
}
```

**Fix:**
- Increase timeout: `rpc: { mode: 'core', timeout: 60_000 }`
- Per-request timeout: `new JetstreamRecordBuilder(data).setTimeout(120_000).build()`
- Ensure both sides use the same RPC mode

### `No handler for subject` warnings

A message arrived on a subject that has no registered handler.

**Causes:**
- Typo in the `@EventPattern()` or `@MessagePattern()` pattern
- Handler not imported in the module
- Subject naming mismatch between publisher and consumer

**Fix:** Compare the full NATS subject in the warning with your handler patterns. See [Naming Conventions](/docs/reference/naming-conventions) for the subject structure.

## Dead letter queue

### `onDeadLetter` not called

The callback only fires when **all** of these conditions are met:
1. `onDeadLetter` is configured in module options
2. The message has been delivered `max_deliver` times (default: 3)
3. The handler throws on every delivery attempt

**Not applicable to:**
- RPC commands (they use `term`, not DLQ)
- Ordered events (no ack/nak)
- Messages that are `term`'d (decode errors, missing handlers)

### DLQ callback throws

If your `onDeadLetter` callback throws, the message is nak'd for another retry instead of being terminated. This is intentional — it allows transient failures (e.g., DLQ database is down) to recover.

### DLQ stream publish fails

When `dlq: { stream }` is configured, the transport republishes exhausted messages to a dedicated DLQ stream. If that publish fails, the transport falls back to the `onDeadLetter` callback and then to `nak()` as a last resort — the full sequence is documented in the [Fallback chain](/docs/guides/dead-letter-queue#fallback-chain).

**Causes:**
- DLQ stream was deleted manually (`nats stream rm orders__microservice_dlq-stream`)
- NATS server is out of disk space or has hit `max_bytes`
- NATS connection dropped between the original publish and the DLQ republish

**Fix:**
1. Check that the DLQ stream exists: `nats stream ls | grep dlq-stream`
2. If it was deleted, restart the pod — the transport's `ensureDlqStream()` recreates it on startup when `dlq` is configured
3. Check NATS server disk usage: `nats server report accounts`
4. Ensure the `dlq.stream` config (if overridden) is compatible with the server's resource limits

## Handler metadata registry

### Entries missing from the KV bucket

The transport only publishes handler metadata when the handler has a `meta` field in its decorator extras. Handlers without `meta` are intentionally skipped — see [Handler Metadata](/docs/patterns/handler-metadata) for the quick-start example.

**Checklist:**
1. Does the handler have `meta: { ... }` in `@EventPattern` / `@MessagePattern`?
2. Is the NATS server version >= 2.10 (KV support)?
3. Did startup succeed? Check logs for `MetadataRegistry` errors.
4. Inspect the bucket: `nats kv ls handler_registry`

### Bucket config mismatch error on startup

NATS KV buckets have immutable config for some fields (`replicas`, `ttl`). If you change these in `forRoot()` after the bucket already exists, startup fails.

**Fix:** Delete your configured metadata bucket — the default name is `handler_registry`, but if you overrode `metadata.bucket` in `forRoot()`, substitute your own. Entries are re-published on the next startup, so the delete is safe.

```bash
# Replace `handler_registry` with your metadata.bucket value if you overrode it
nats kv rm handler_registry

# Restart the service → fresh bucket with new config
```

## Stream migration

### Consumer self-healing waits on "migration in progress"

If a previous migration was interrupted (process killed mid-phase, NATS crash), an orphaned `{stream}__migration_backup` stream exists. During **consumer self-healing** (after a live consumer's iterator breaks), the transport detects the backup stream and refuses to recreate the consumer until the backup is gone — the self-healing loop waits with exponential backoff. This check runs only in the recovery path, not during initial application startup.

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
nats stream ls | grep migration_backup
```

**Fix:** None needed in most cases — self-healing will recover automatically once the migrating pod finishes and cleans up the backup. If the backup is orphaned permanently (the migrating pod died and nobody retried), manually inspect it and either retain it (if it contains messages you need) or delete it with `nats stream rm <stream>__migration_backup` so self-healing can resume.

See [Stream Migration — Error handling](/docs/guides/stream-migration#error-handling) for the full recovery flow.

### Publisher errors during rolling update

During the brief window between Phase 2 (delete) and Phase 3 (create) of a stream migration, publishers may see "stream not found" errors. The window is effectively one NATS round-trip, but is not zero. Mitigations:

- For `client.emit()` (fire-and-forget), accept the loss or implement caller-side retry.
- For `client.send()` (RPC), the caller receives an error and can retry.
- For zero-loss migrations, schedule migration during a maintenance window with publishers paused.

## Startup issues

### `listen() hangs` on startup

If the application doesn't finish starting:
1. **Ordered consumer can't connect** — The stream might not exist yet. Check that the ordered stream is created before the consumer tries to connect.
2. **NATS connection timeout** — The initial connection attempt blocks startup.

### `Stream already exists with different config`

NATS returns an error when you try to update a stream with incompatible changes (e.g., changing retention policy on an existing stream).

**Fix:** Delete the stream and let the transport recreate it:
```bash
nats stream rm <stream-name>
```

:::caution
Deleting a stream destroys all messages in it. Only do this in development or when data loss is acceptable.

## Typed error handling with `NatsErrorCode`

When your own code needs to react to a NATS JetStream API error, use the `NatsErrorCode` enum instead of matching on error messages. It covers the three error conditions the transport itself observes most often:

```typescript
import { NatsErrorCode } from '@horizon-republic/nestjs-jetstream';

try {
  await jsm.streams.info('orders__microservice_ev-stream');
} catch (err) {
  const code = (err as { code?: number }).code;

  if (code === NatsErrorCode.StreamNotFound) {
    // 10059 — stream does not exist yet, safe to create
  } else if (code === NatsErrorCode.ConsumerNotFound) {
    // 10014 — consumer was deleted externally
  } else if (code === NatsErrorCode.ConsumerAlreadyExists) {
    // 10148 — race on consumer create, fetch the existing one instead
  } else {
    throw err;
  }
}
```

The library itself uses these constants in its self-healing flows (`src/server/infrastructure/consumer.provider.ts`), so consumer code that wraps library calls can reuse the same vocabulary.
