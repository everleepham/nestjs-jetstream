# Performance Tuning

This guide covers how to tune the transport for high-throughput workloads. The most impactful settings are backpressure controls and concurrency limits.

## Backpressure & flow control

Pull consumers provide **implicit backpressure** — the client controls how fast it pulls messages from the server. The transport never receives more messages than it can handle.

The message flow through the system:

```text
NATS Server → pull consumer (max_ack_pending) → consume() buffer → RxJS mergeMap (concurrency) → handler → ack → frees slot
```

The primary flow control knob is `max_ack_pending` on the consumer. It limits how many messages can be in-flight (delivered but not yet acknowledged) at any time. When the limit is reached, the server stops delivering new messages until existing ones are acknowledged — creating natural backpressure.

### Configuration options

| Option | Default | Effect |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `consumer.max_ack_pending` | 100 | Max in-flight unacked messages |
| `consumer.ack_wait` | 10s (events) / 5min (RPC) | Ack deadline before redelivery |
| `concurrency` | unlimited | Limits parallel handler execution |
| `consume.max_messages` | `@nats-io/jetstream` default | Internal prefetch buffer size |
| `consume.threshold_messages` | 75% of max_messages | Auto-refill trigger |

### How these interact

- **`max_ack_pending`** is the ceiling. The server will never deliver more than this many unacked messages.
- **`concurrency`** controls how many messages are processed in parallel by your handlers. If `concurrency` is lower than `max_ack_pending`, excess messages wait in the internal buffer.
- **`consume.max_messages`** and **`consume.threshold_messages`** control the prefetch buffer — how many messages the `@nats-io/jetstream` client requests from the server in a single batch and when it requests more.

For most workloads, tuning `max_ack_pending` and `concurrency` is sufficient.

## Consume options

The `consume` field controls the internal prefetch buffer used by the `@nats-io/jetstream` `consume()` call. These options determine how aggressively the client pulls messages from the server.

```typescript
events: {
  consume: {
    max_messages: 200,          // prefetch up to 200 messages
    threshold_messages: 150,    // request more when buffer drops below 150
    idle_heartbeat: 10_000,     // 10s heartbeat to detect stalled consumers
  },
}
```

The `idle_heartbeat` option enables the server to send periodic heartbeats when there are no messages to deliver. This allows the client to detect broken connections and re-establish the subscription.

## Concurrency control

The `concurrency` option limits the number of messages processed in parallel by the `mergeMap` operator in the message pipeline. Without it, all pulled messages are dispatched to handlers immediately.

```typescript
events: {
  concurrency: 200,  // max 200 handlers running in parallel
}
```

**Guideline:** Set `concurrency` at or below `max_ack_pending`. If `concurrency` exceeds `max_ack_pending`, the server-side limit will be the effective bottleneck anyway.

When `concurrency` is set, messages that exceed the limit are buffered in the RxJS pipeline until a handler slot frees up. This prevents overloading downstream resources (databases, external APIs) while still maintaining a full prefetch buffer.

## Ack extension

Long-running handlers risk exceeding the `ack_wait` deadline, causing redelivery of messages that are still being processed. The `ackExtension` option prevents this by periodically extending the ack deadline while the handler is running.

```typescript
events: {
  consumer: { ack_wait: toNanos(30, 'seconds') },
  ackExtension: true,
}
```

When enabled, the transport calls `msg.working()` at regular intervals (at half the `ack_wait` period) to signal that the message is still being processed. This resets the ack deadline on the server.

**When to use:**
- Handlers that call slow external APIs or run complex computations.
- RPC handlers with long timeouts — `ackExtension` keeps the command message alive while the handler runs.

**Interaction with RPC timeout:** For JetStream RPC, the RPC timeout determines how long the caller waits. The `ackExtension` keeps the server-side message alive independently. Both should be configured to accommodate the expected handler duration.

## S2 compression

All streams default to [Snappy S2 compression](https://github.com/nats-io/nats-server), reducing disk I/O and storage with negligible CPU overhead (~1-3%). Requires **NATS Server >= 2.10**.

See [Default Configs — S2 Compression](/docs/reference/default-configs) for details and how to override per stream kind.

## Connection defaults

The transport configures unlimited reconnection attempts (`maxReconnectAttempts: -1`) and a 1-second reconnection interval by default. This ensures the application automatically recovers from transient network failures.

See [Default Configs — Connection Defaults](/docs/reference/default-configs#connection-defaults) for the full list and how to override.

## Complete example

A production-ready configuration tuned for high throughput:

```typescript
import { toNanos } from '@horizon-republic/nestjs-jetstream';

JetstreamModule.forRoot({
  name: 'orders',
  servers: ['nats://localhost:4222'],
  events: {
    consumer: { max_ack_pending: 500, ack_wait: toNanos(30, 'seconds') },
    consume: { idle_heartbeat: 10_000 },
    concurrency: 200,
    ackExtension: true,
  },
  broadcast: {
    concurrency: 50,
  },
  rpc: {
    mode: 'jetstream',
    timeout: 60_000,
    concurrency: 50,
    ackExtension: true,
  },
})
```

This configuration:
- Allows up to 500 unacked event messages, with 200 processed in parallel.
- Extends ack deadlines automatically for long-running event and RPC handlers.
- Limits broadcast processing to 50 concurrent handlers.
- Sets a 60-second RPC timeout with ack extension to prevent redelivery during processing.

## Performance expectations

Actual throughput depends heavily on handler complexity, network latency, and NATS deployment. Here are rough ballpark numbers for a single Node.js instance on modern hardware (16-core, 32 GB RAM, local NATS):

| Scenario | Throughput | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Event handlers** (fast, no I/O) | 10k–50k msg/s | CPU-bound; concurrency helps up to core count |
| **Event handlers** (DB write per msg) | 1k–5k msg/s | I/O-bound; increase concurrency and `max_ack_pending` |
| **RPC Core mode** (fast handler) | 5k–20k req/s | Lowest latency; no stream overhead |
| **RPC JetStream mode** | 1k–10k req/s | Adds stream write + inbox reply |
| **Broadcast** (N instances) | Same per-instance as events | Each instance processes independently |

:::info These are guidelines, not guarantees
Always benchmark your specific workload. The bottleneck is usually the handler, not the transport. Profile your handlers first before tuning transport settings.

### Measuring your throughput

1. **NATS monitoring:** Enable the [NATS monitoring endpoint](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/configuration/monitoring) (`-m 8222`) and check `msgs_in`/`msgs_out` rates.
2. **Consumer lag:** `nats consumer info <stream> <consumer>` — watch "Num Pending" to detect falling behind.
3. **Application metrics:** Use [Lifecycle Hooks](/docs/guides/lifecycle-hooks) to emit Prometheus counters for `MessageRouted`, `Error`, and `RpcTimeout` events.
