/**
 * Orchestrates blue-green stream recreation for immutable property changes.
 *
 * Uses NATS stream sourcing (server-side copy) to preserve messages:
 *   1. Backup: create temp stream sourcing from original
 *   2. Delete original
 *   3. Create original with new config
 *   4. Restore: source from temp into new original
 *   5. Cleanup: remove temp stream
 *
 * **Rolling update safety:** During Phase 4 (restore), other pods' self-healing
 * may recreate consumers and begin consuming restored messages. For workqueue
 * streams this means acked messages are deleted, which could cause the sourcing
 * count check to stall. In practice, server-side sourcing is much faster than
 * consumer pull (network round-trips for each ack), so this is unlikely for
 * streams under ~100k messages. For very large streams, scale down to 1 replica
 * before migrating, or schedule migration during low-traffic windows.
 *
 * There is also a brief window (milliseconds) between Phase 2 (delete) and
 * Phase 3 (create) where the stream does not exist. Publishers may see
 * temporary "stream not found" errors. Client-side retry is the caller's
 * responsibility.
 *
